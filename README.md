# Svelte App for Hennge challenge !

This is my Svelte implementation of Hennge challenge !

The challenge consisted in implementing a responsive webmail interface from static mockups.

This was pretty challenging & interesting, because there were lots of tricky details hidden in mockups, that required meticulous analysis.

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:
